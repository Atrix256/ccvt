# ccvt
This is the source code that goes along with the paper "Capacity-Constrained Point Distributions: A Variant of Lloydâ€™s Method"
which you can read at http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.177.6047&rep=rep1&type=pdf

the presentation for the paper says you can get the source at ccvt.googlecode.com, but google code no longer exists.

Luckily there is an archive of google code projects, containing ccvt, which can be found at https://code.google.com/archive/p/ccvt/source/default/source

Everything here except this readme file is the contents of that repository (i deleted the useless svn folders though)
